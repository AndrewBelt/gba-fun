This is my playground for Gameboy Advance development.
There is no real point of this "game" other than to learn about the GBA architecture and to test new ideas for future games.

Feel free to fork just the build system. It handles a number of things, with minimal editing of the Makefile, such as asset compilation into the program binary and tileset compression (with [grit](http://www.coranac.com/projects/grit/)).
